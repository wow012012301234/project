                answer="Vulnerability scanning is commonly considered to be the most efficient way to check your site against a huge list of known vulnerabilities - and identify potential weaknesses in the security of your applications. Vulnerability scanning can be used as part of a standalone assessment, or as part of a continuous overall security monitoring strategy"

                ques="how long does a website security scan take"
                answer="The duration of a scan depends on many things, including network latency, size of site being scanned, the serverâ€™s resources and services running on the scanned server. The average scan time for a network scan is 20 minutes, while the average time for a web scan is between 2 and 4 hours."
